# Introduction

Digital Emblems provide a communication path by which the issuer of an 
emblem may convey a cryptographically verifiable set of attributes
which bind the emblem to the issuer and may be evaluated by a validator.

The DIEM WG seeks to define a standard architecture and presentation
methods to create, display, validate, and
interpret emblems across applications and platforms.

The type of asset will generally dictate the record types used to 
bind the emblem to the asset, and the relationship between the asset 
and the validator will generally define the mechanism by which
validators retrieve digital emblems for the asset.

# Initial Scope

To simplify the initial work of DIEM, the initial scope is limited
to attested and self-signed emblems bound to digital assets.

The working group is tasked with developing: 1) use cases and requirements related to the
initial scope, 2) an architecture that captures the relationships between issuer, emblem, 
asset, and validator, 3) a specification for binding emblems to issuers and assets, and 
4) a specification for discovery mechanisms supported by the initial scope.

The working group will liaise with appropriate organisations and relevant IETF WGs to 
facilitate re-use of existing protocols and capabilities.

It is anticipated that a future re-chartering of the working group will broaden its scope 
to include more of the known use cases and user requirements beyond this initial one.

## Deliverables

The DIEM WG will work on the following milestones for the defined scope:

1. Requirements for the initial use case (Informational)
2. Architecture document containing a taxonomy and overall information flows (Informational)
3. A protocol specification describing the binding of emblems to issuers and assets (Proposed Standard or Experimental)
4. A protocol specification describing an emblem discovery mechanism for the initial use case (Proposed Standard
or Experimental)
